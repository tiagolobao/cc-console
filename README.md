# cc-console

Console Mod for CrossCode (!!In progress!!)

## Steps

Checklist
- [x] Display messages in a UI overlay    
- [x] Implement clear and close buttons
- [x] Toggle with some key
- [ ] Notifications for new logs
- [ ] Log File for uncaughtException and unhandledRejections
- [ ] Overwrite the console object
- [ ] Handle exceeded number of logs
- [ ] Resize window functionality
- [ ] Handling messages with repeated content from last log 
- [ ] More items to this list later....

To deal with:
"continuing with the 4th point, it would be also nice if opening the console when the notifications are displayed would slide them down to the bottom of the console"
